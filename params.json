{"name":"How to get your data on opendata.swiss","tagline":"Information and guidance for the production portal for Swiss open government data","body":"last modified: 21.09.2015\r\n\r\n**By the end of 2015 the Swiss open government data _pilot_ portal [opendata.admin.ch](http://opendata.admin.ch) will be replaced by the _production_ portal «opendata.swiss». Below you can find further information and guidance relevant for this transition to both data publishers and engineers in their organisations.**\r\n\r\nIf ‹open data› is new to you, you can find further information about what it is, and what it is good for on [opendefinition.org](http://opendefinition.org).\r\n\r\nJump directly to information and guidance for:\r\n1. [Potential open data publishers](#you-are-a-potential-open-data-publisher)\r\n2. [Interested engineers, who are managing data](#you-are-an-interested-engineer)\r\n\r\n***\r\n# 1. You are a potential open data publisher\r\n\r\n## Get ready to publish open data!\r\nIn April 2014 the Swiss Federal Council adopted the [Open-Government-Data-Strategy Switzerland 2014–2018](http://www.egovernment.ch/umsetzung/00881/00883/index.html?lang=en&download=NHzLpZeg7t,lnp6I0NTU042l2Z6ln1ad1IZn4Z2qZpnO2Yuq2Z6gpJCDdYF_fWym162epYbg2c_JjKbNoKSn6A--). \r\n\r\nAll communal, cantonal, and federal authorities (cities, cantons, offices, regions, interfederal organisations etc.), as well as communal, cantonal, and federal businesses (e.g. SBB, Post, Swisscom etc.) are called on to make data available in open, machine-readable formats, while continuing to ensure privacy and security.\r\n\r\nOpendata.swiss is the production portal, which will replace the pilot portal [opendata.admin.ch](http://opendata.admin.ch) by the end of this year, implementing the decisions taken by the ‹Open Government Data› project organisation under the leadership of the [Swiss Federal Archives (SFA)](http://www.bar.admin.ch/themen/01648/01968/index.html?lang=en) in the pilot phase.\r\n\r\n## How can I publish my data on opendata.swiss?\r\nYou need to publish standardised data about your data, so-called metadata.\r\nFor publishers, opendata.swiss offers three ways to add their datasets to the metadata catalogue:\r\n\r\n| Use case                            | Solution          |\r\n|-------------------------------------|-------------------| \r\n| * I want to publish certain datasets, which are updated at rare intervals.  | * I manually submit my metadata through a web page on «opendata.swiss».  | \r\n| * I want to publish several datasets and/or datasets which are updated regularly.  | * I manually import my metadata by uploading an XML file ((see example here)) on «opendata.swiss».  | \r\n| * I want to publish a large number of datasets and/or datasets which are updated frequently.  | * I automatically import my metadata running a metadata harvester. I can use a standard harvester on «opendata.swiss» ([see examples](http://dcat-ap-switzerland.readthedocs.org/en/latest/harvester.html)) or custom-develop my own.  | \r\n\r\n## These data publishers are ready today:\r\n\r\n* Swiss Federal Archives\r\n* Swisstopo\r\n* ZH-GIS\r\n\r\n## How can I get involved?\r\nInterested data publishers should contact the OPENDATA.SWISS portal team: opendata@bar.admin.ch\r\n\r\n## Key members of the portal team are:\r\n| Role Name                           | Function          | Organisation                       |\r\n|-------------------------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------| \r\n| OPENDATA.SWISS Portal Owner         | Jean-Luc Cochard  | Head IT, Swiss Federal Archives    |\r\n| “Open Government Data” Project Lead | Juan Pablo Lovato | Swiss Federal Archives             |\r\n| OPENDATA.SWISS Portal Manager       | Pierre Dumas      | Swiss Federal Archives             |\r\n| OPENDATA.SWISS Portal Provider      | Andreas Amsler    | Open Data Product Owner, Liip Ltd. |\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n# 2. You are an interested engineer\r\n\r\n## What metadata schema do I have to follow?\r\nThe “Open Government Data” project organisation have worked out a joint solution; see all documents “M8 - Selection and definition of the OGD standards” on http://www.egovernment.ch/umsetzung/00881/00883/01112/index.html?lang=en. The portal OPENDATA.SWISS implements these standards as follows: http://dcat-ap-switzerland.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ \r\n\r\n## How can I test if I am ready?\r\nGet the example XML file from https://github.com/ogdch/dcat-ap-docs/blob/master/ogdch_dcatap_import.rdf.\r\nFill the XML file for your metadata following the documentation on http://dcat-ap-switzerland.readthedocs.org/en/latest/dcat-ap-format.html.\r\nSend your XML-file for validation to the portal tea : opendata@bar.admin.ch \r\nThe portal team gets back to you with feedback.\r\n\r\n## I have got an issue. How can I get support?\r\nPlease create an issue on: https://github.com/ogdch/dcat-ap-docs/issues ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
