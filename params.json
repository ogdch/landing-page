Below you can find further information and guidance relevant for  this transition to both data publishers and engineers in their organisations.**\r\n\r\nIf \"Open Data\" is new to you, you can find further information about what it is, and what it is good for on [opendefinition.org](http://opendefinition.org).\r\n\r\n***\r\n# You are a potential open data publisher\r\n\r\n## Get ready to publish open data!\r\nOn 16 April 2014 the Federal Council adopted the Open-Government-Data-Strategy Switzerland 2014–2018. \r\nAll communal, cantonal, and federal authorities (cities, cantons, offices, regions, interfederal organisations etc.), as well as communal, cantonal, and federal businesses (e.g. SBB, Post, Swisscom etc.) are called on to make data available in open, machine-readable formats, while continuing to ensure privacy and security.\r\n“OPENDATA.SWISS” is the production portal, which will replace the pilot portal opendata.admin.ch by the end of this year, implementing the decisions taken by the “Open Government Data” project organisation under the leadership of the Swiss Federal Archives (SFA) in the pilot phase.\r\n\r\n## How can I publish my data on OPENDATA.SWISS?\r\nYou need to publish standardised data about your data, so-called metadata.\r\nFor publishers, OPENDATA.SWISS offers three ways to add their datasets to the metadata catalogue:\r\nUse case\r\nSolution\r\nI want to publish certain datasets, which are updated at rare intervals.\r\nI manually submit my metadata through a web page on OPENDATA.SWISS.\r\nI want to publish several datasets and/or datasets which are updated regularly.\r\nI manually import my metadata by uploading an XML file ((see example here)) on OPENDATA.SWISS.\r\nI want to publish a large number of datasets and/or datasets which are updated frequently.\r\nI automatically import my metadata running a metadata harvester. I can use a standard harvester on OPENDATA.SWISS ((see examples here)) or custom-develop my own.\r\n\r\n## These data publishers are ready today:\r\n\r\n* Swiss Federal Archives\r\n* Swisstopo\r\n* ZH-GIS\r\n\r\n## How can I get involved?\r\nInterested data publishers should contact the OPENDATA.SWISS portal team: opendata@bar.admin.ch\r\n\r\n## Key members of the portal team are:\r\n| Role Name                           | Function          | Organisation                       |\r\n|-------------------------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------| \r\n| OPENDATA.SWISS Portal Owner         | Jean-Luc Cochard  | Head IT, Swiss Federal Archives    |\r\n| “Open Government Data” Project Lead | Juan Pablo Lovato | Swiss Federal Archives             |\r\n| OPENDATA.SWISS Portal Manager       | Pierre Dumas      | Swiss Federal Archives             |\r\n| OPENDATA.SWISS Portal Provider      | Andreas Amsler    | Open Data Product Owner, Liip Ltd. |\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n# You are an interested engineer\r\n\r\n## What metadata schema do I have to follow?\r\nThe “Open Government Data” project organisation have worked out a joint solution; see all documents “M8 - Selection and definition of the OGD standards” on http://www.egovernment.ch/umsetzung/00881/00883/01112/index.html?lang=en.
