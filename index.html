<p>By the end of this year the pilot portal <a href="http://opendata.admin.ch">http://opendata.admin.ch</a> will be replaced by the production portal OPENDATA.SWISS. Below you can find further information and guidance relevant for  this transition to both data publishers and engineers in their organisations.</p>

<p>If "Open Data" is new to you, you can find further information about what it is, and what it is good for on <a href="http://opendefinition.org">http://opendefinition.org</a>.</p>

<p>You are a potential open data publisher:
Get ready to publish open data!
On 16 April 2014 the Federal Council adopted the Open-Government-Data-Strategy Switzerland 2014–2018. 
All communal, cantonal, and federal authorities (cities, cantons, offices, regions, interfederal organisations etc.), as well as communal, cantonal, and federal businesses (e.g. SBB, Post, Swisscom etc.) are called on to make data available in open, machine-readable formats, while continuing to ensure privacy and security.
“OPENDATA.SWISS” is the production portal, which will replace the pilot portal opendata.admin.ch by the end of this year, implementing the decisions taken by the “Open Government Data” project organisation under the leadership of the Swiss Federal Archives (SFA) in the pilot phase.</p>

<p>How can I publish my data on OPENDATA.SWISS?
You need to publish standardised data about your data, so-called metadata.
For publishers, OPENDATA.SWISS offers three ways to add their datasets to the metadata catalogue:
Use case
Solution
I want to publish certain datasets, which are updated at rare intervals.
I manually submit my metadata through a web page on OPENDATA.SWISS.
I want to publish several datasets and/or datasets which are updated regularly.
I manually import my metadata by uploading an XML file ((see example here)) on OPENDATA.SWISS.
I want to publish a large number of datasets and/or datasets which are updated frequently.
I automatically import my metadata running a metadata harvester. I can use a standard harvester on OPENDATA.SWISS ((see examples here)) or custom-develop my own.</p>

<p>These data publishers are ready today:
Swiss Federal Archives
Swisstopo
ZH-GIS</p>

<p>How can I get involved?
Interested data publishers should contact the OPENDATA.SWISS portal team: <a href="mailto:opendata@bar.admin.ch">opendata@bar.admin.ch</a></p>

<p>You are an interested engineer:
What metadata schema do I have to follow?
The “Open Government Data” project organisation have worked out a joint solution; see all documents “M8 - Selection and definition of the OGD standards” on <a href="http://www.egovernment.ch/umsetzung/00881/00883/01112/index.html?lang=en">http://www.egovernment.ch/umsetzung/00881/00883/01112/index.html?lang=en</a>. The portal OPENDATA.SWISS implements these standards as follows: <a href="http://dcat-ap-switzerland.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">http://dcat-ap-switzerland.readthedocs.org/en/latest/</a> </p>

<p>How can I test if I am ready?
Get the example XML file from <a href="https://github.com/ogdch/dcat-ap-docs/blob/master/ogdch_dcatap_import.rdf">https://github.com/ogdch/dcat-ap-docs/blob/master/ogdch_dcatap_import.rdf</a>.
Fill the XML file for your metadata following the documentation on <a href="http://dcat-ap-switzerland.readthedocs.org/en/latest/dcat-ap-format.html">http://dcat-ap-switzerland.readthedocs.org/en/latest/dcat-ap-format.html</a>.
Send your XML-file for validation to the portal tea : <a href="mailto:opendata@bar.admin.ch">opendata@bar.admin.ch</a> 
The portal team gets back to you with feedback.</p>
